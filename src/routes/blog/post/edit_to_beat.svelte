        I literally just went out and filmed random things outside of my house.
        Just to give you guys an understanding of what cutting to the beat is
        going. The techno So without further ado, let's jump into Adobe Premiere
        OK, so let's go ahead and take a look at the edit that I did. So here's
        a video that I created in like like 2 minutes, literally. So just to
        give you an idea, I went out and just shot some footage outside and this
        is what is going to look like when you're cutting to the beat. You're
        using the music as the motivating factor of this video, and it is
        leading the entire visuals. So you want to cut to it something that's
        super helpful if you guys are having trouble, like hearing the beat and
        you're just not being able to get those precise cuts that you need, come
        over here to the audio level and just go ahead and double click this box
        and it'll open up this entire audio level and then you can zoom in and
        really see where this audio is happening. As you can see, it is a cut,
        right when the snare or the beats, right? Right. When the beat hits, you
        can see that it cuts right here. So if we watch this right we can hit it
        right on the beat. It's right there. So you don't have to do the
        guessing work of hearing it. You can actually see it right here on your
        monitor. So guys, when you're editing to the beat, you don't want to
        have the same exact cadence and the rhythm of the visuals, cutting on
        the snare or the bass every like one, two, three, hit, one, two, three,
        hit. What you want to do is definitely be able to get a little bit
        creative with it, switch it up from time to time. It's OK to follow a
        pattern here and there, but you definitely want to switch it up as time
        goes. So as you can see my video, I have a hit on the bass drop. I have
        a hit snare, one snare, two hits on snare, three comes in here, hits on
        a bass hit, then it does a one, two, three, four, five just a little
        bit. And we're just kind of hitting each one of those as you can watch
        here. And then we go back to the snare hit, then we go back to a bass
        hit coming into the final bass hit at the top of the chord progression
        so definitely something you want to get creative with and you want to
        have that music really motivate this. Then use the audio as your guide
        to edit whatever it sounds like, whatever feels like. That's what the
        edit is going to look like. Really use that audio to motivate this. This
        is a feel game more so than a just knowing game. You really got to feel
        out how the audio makes it feel, how you're going to use the visuals
        with the feeling of it and go from there. Just make sure to stay
        creative with all of it and switch up the beats as you go and experiment
        with it. All right. Guys, I hope this was helpful for you. If you guys
        have any questions whatsoever, just go ahead or leave it down below and
        I'll get back to you guys on that as soon as possible. Go and create
        some creative people and I'll see you in the next video pick up.
