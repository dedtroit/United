    <h3>
        Welcome back to brand new video. My name is Danny Matthews. Now, today,
        somebody asked me to create a video specifically about building a
        portfolio for editing. This is our dear friend here. So you can thank
        them because they're the ones that motivated me to create this video. So
        I hope this video is helpful for all of you. Really quick, what is a
        portfolio for video editing? Well, a video editing portfolio is
        showcasing work that you have done editing showcasing to people, and
        that's how you and get clients. But how do you do this when you have no
        clients? How do you do this when you have no footage or any of that? I'm
        going to show you how waking up with the thirst of adrenaline is what I
        live for. I can't live a life not knowing how far I can push the
        boundaries, pushing myself The thirst for adrenaline, the rush I get
        going down the track is unlike any other. This is what I live for. All
        right, guys. So first things first. When you're creating a portfolio,
        you need to know what on earth are you trying to target? What clientele
        are you trying to do? Promotional? Are you trying to do weddings? Are
        you trying to do you know, are you trying to do, like, car videos like I
        just showed you? Once you find a place that where you are in the
        clientele that you are trying to reach or already reaching. Now,
        currently, what you're going to want to do is the best thing is go up on
        any kind of stock footage place. I went on an art grid because it is, in
        my opinion, very, very great for stock footage. It has high quality
        footage and it has like four folders. First of stuff. I went to one
        dude, I found all of this footage and I took the clips that I wanted and
        I quickly put this montage together. Now, one thing is for I created you
        the free version has a good watermark, as you see in the video. And if
        you were to download from Art Grid, you would probably pay about, I
        think, $40 for the month. You get that higher quality footage, which you
        definitely want to have, and you would just kind of cancel it out the
        first month, take the footage that you need, create really great
        portfolio pieces. Next question is how many portfolio pieces do you need
        to be showcasing to people? I say around three to four. Now you can get
        clientele with one product. I definitely suggest doing about three or
        four. Now, the reason I say three or four is one says, Hey, I've done it
        before here. I can do it again. And yes, you can get yes you can get
        paying clients and I've done it before. Two is like, Yeah, you know, I'm
        still dipping my toes in the water, getting all of that. Three is
        established. They have three different things to look at and they
        understand that you are an experienced editor, obviously, based upon
        your great quality of video that you've edited together. And four,
        again, it's kind of that same space. Once you kind of get more than
        four, people just don't care. They're not going to watch it, I'll be
        honest with you. They're going to like watch through it like a little
        bit from each video, get an understanding. All right. You're a great
        editor. You're not a great editor, and they're going to move on. So you
        really want to make sure that these portfolio pieces are impact As for
        me, I just did it. I literally created a video off our created in about
        2 hours. It's not portfolio piece worthy, in my opinion right now, at
        least. Definitely something that you want to put time into and you want
        to have all the layers. I'm talking everything I'm talking, cultivating
        sound effects, voiceover, if applicable, great music, and then make sure
        that all these cuts are super thought out. Guys, look, you don't have to
        overthink this thing, but you do have to be but you do have to take into
        consideration of how you're cutting it, the whole flow of the video and
        how the story is presented. This is what people are going to look at and
        they will be engaged and they'll be understanding of this, whether they
        understand what you did or not and the editing, they're going to feel
        what you are trying to convey. So make sure that you really thoughtful
        about the editing. Literally, you can take footage off of anywhere. It's
        so easy to do and you can create any type of video you want. Video
        editing has the most flexibility when it comes to that. You don't need a
        camera and you don't need to film anything. So guys, that is how you're
        going to create your beautiful portfolio and make sure I'm telling you
        guys, take your time on these and really make it shine because this is
        what's going to be making the money for you when you present your pitch,
        when you present the video to somebody and they're looking at these
        videos and they're like, All right, you know what you're doing. These
        are well done. All right, guys, I hope that this video is helpful for
        you. If you have any questions about this, I know it can get confusing,
        but honestly, just start a step one, make sure you understand your
        demographic. Download that stock footage create that beautiful video and
        present it to them. If you got any questions about this, guy's going to
        leave it down below and I'll get back to you guys on it and I'll see you
        guys in the next video piece out.
