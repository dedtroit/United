    <h3>
        What's up? My name is Danny Matthews, and today we're going to be
        talking about the most famous YouTube cut in all of the world.jump, cut.
        So without further ado let's jump into Adobe Premiere and show you
        exactly what this is. Real quick, if you're subscribed to DoorDash,
        Uber, Kroger, any kind of food service, you might as well subscribe here
        because it's absolutely free and you get free information. Oh, my
        goodness. Footage. OK. Goodness me. It took like 40 hours. So here we
        are. We have a clip that is literally just one clip long where I start
        pushing into the actor and it goes like, this is pushing it in. And what
        is a jump cut? This is what a jump cut is. What we are going to do here
        is we are going to cut out a lot of the moving forward and it's going to
        show it literally jump cutting and that's what they call a jump go. So
        go ahead and delete some of those clips right there and go and watch
        your film back and that's what a jump cut is. Very simple. This is what
        would be used more in a real live situation for any kind of video that
        you may be doing. For a YouTube video, you're going to be cutting
        between clips and just kind of making those really sharp cut clips
        between things that were your move. And in that jump cut in YouTube, and
        the reason people love using this cut is because it keeps high
        engagement. That way, people aren't bored, aren't losing engagement.
        They're still in contact with what's going on in the video that way.
        People just don't lose interest in the video. The reason YouTubers love
        these jump cuts is because it gets right to the point and there's not
        wasting anybody's time and people like yourself are able to get
        information quickly. So that is why knowing the jump cut, understanding
        why it's useful and how it's used is very important. As well as when you
        create videos, any kind of social cuts, you understand why you would
        want to use this in here or why you would not. Main reason in a jump cut
        in these types of videos for any kind of promotional or any kind of
        social reel that you might have is because you want to show time of
        speed is moving quickly and you get to keep that engagement of your
        viewers. So there it is, the jump cut guys, hopefully that this video is
        helpful for you.
